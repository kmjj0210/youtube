We have the lights tied into their own battery bank that we have mounted in the bed of the truck so it doesn't pull any energy from the truck. We love they way they turned out on this truck!

I had a vision in my mind on what I wanted but couldn't get it dialed in just right till I handed the design work over to their team. Once design was dialed in they sent the wrap out and made it happen! We've been using ArcticFX for years now helping us with everything from my personal sleds to our giveaway trucks, they are absolute animals in the wrap game.
